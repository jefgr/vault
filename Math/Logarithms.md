# Properties of Logarithms

In mathematics, logarithms are the inverse operations to exponentiation. Below are some key properties of logarithms.

## 1. **Definition of Logarithm**
The logarithm of a number $x$ to the base $b$ is the exponent $y$ such that:
$$
b^y = x
$$
This is written as:
$$
y = \log_b(x)
$$

## 2. **Logarithm of a Product**
The logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms:
$$
\log_b(x \cdot y) = \log_b(x) + \log_b(y)
$$

## 3. **Logarithm of a Quotient**
The logarithm of a quotient is the difference of the logarithms:
$$
\log_b\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \log_b(x) - \log_b(y)
$$

## 4. **Logarithm of a Power**
The logarithm of a power can be expressed as the exponent times the logarithm of the base:
$$
\log_b(x^n) = n \cdot \log_b(x)
$$

## 5. **Change of Base Formula**
You can change the base of a logarithm using the following formula:
$$
\log_b(x) = \frac{\log_a(x)}{\log_a(b)}
$$
Where $a$ is any new base.

## 6. **Logarithm of 1**
For any base $b$, the logarithm of 1 is always 0:
$$
\log_b(1) = 0
$$

## 7. **Logarithm of the Base**
The logarithm of the base to itself is always 1:
$$
\log_b(b) = 1
$$

## 8. **Natural Logarithm**
The natural logarithm is a logarithm with base $e$, where $e \approx 2.718$. It is denoted as $\ln(x)$:
$$
\ln(x) = \log_e(x)
$$

## 9. **Logarithmic Identity**
For any positive number $x$:
$$
b^{\log_b(x)} = x
$$

These properties provide the foundation for manipulating and simplifying logarithmic expressions in various mathematical contexts.
