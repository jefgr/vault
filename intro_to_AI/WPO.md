1. For a robotic football player, develop a PEAS description of the task environment. 

| Agent                   | Performance measure   | Environment                                                                                                                                            | Actuators                                            | Sensors                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| robotic football player | Amount of matches won | Footballfield lines, scores, goals, teammates and opponents, ball (location, speed, possession), gametime, referees, weatherconditions, groundcoverage | limbs (arms and legs), head, speaker (communication) | Orientation, cameras, microphone, pressuresensors, distancemeasurements, weatherinstruments, balance/gyroscope, accelerometer, voltmeter (batterijpercentage checken),  |

2. For the agent in the previous exercise, characterize the environment according to the properties given at the end this lectureâ€™s slides (or Section 2.3 of the textbook). 
> Partially Observable: You don't know what other players want/ are going to do; you cannot measure the ground condition of the whole field at the same time
> 
> Stochastic: there are external forces on the environment, other players may interfere
> 
> Sequential: within a single match, the actions of the agent are dependant on previous actions; each match is episodic, a match doesn't influence the next/previous one
> 
> Dynamic: Ball can be moving, other players may take actions, matchclock keeps going
> 
> Continuous: Toestanden en acties zijn niet telbaar dus continuous
> 
> Multiple Agent: Multiple players

3. Fill in the table below and discuss your answers with your colleagues.
